ReactJS App Tutorial (Reference: JavaScript Mastery on YouTube)

## Pre-requisites:
1. Node.js - To run JavaScript code outside of a browser (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. An IDE of choice - Like VS Code, WebStorm etc.
3. Git for version control (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

NOTE: Ensure that node and npm are added into PATH environment variables.

Baseline Application (starting-point): Vite - Created by running `npm create vite@latest` on the command line.

Once the baseline is created, the dependencies such as react and react-dom have to be installed.
  - cd into the app directory
  - run the command `npm install` or `npm i`
  - To test if you can run the react app, run `npm run dev` in the same directory
